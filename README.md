### Notes

* This is a hands-on workshop. We will be using Neo4j and a Jupyter notebook to run Python.
* You can either [install Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download) locally or spin up a blank [Neo4j Sandbox instance](https://neo4jsandbox.com)
* The Jupyter notebooks can be run locally (clone this repo) or through Google's Collaboratory service. *NOTE: If you run the notebooks through Collaboratory you'll need to use Neo4j Sandbox as the hosted notebooks cannot connect to your local macine.*
* Slides are available here.
